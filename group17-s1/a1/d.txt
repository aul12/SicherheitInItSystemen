Decrypt AES-encrypted file:
$ openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -d -in a-enc-aes.txt -K EB46209563FC7F12A6F4EF32BF92CDFF965BE46427FAE16BFB49BC04A6E6F8C2 -iv 1CBE01D9411F49198D30EA0A490ED018

-d to decrypt
again, specify algorithm version, key and IV used to encrypt the file
same key and IV are used since AES is a symmetric algorithm. 


Decrypt RSA-encrypted file
$ openssl rsautl -in b-enc-rsa.txt -decrypt -inkey private.pem

specify -decrypt to decrypt :)
Since the file was encrypted with the public key, private key is needed to decrypt it.
