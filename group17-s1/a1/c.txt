Since RSA is an asymmetric algorithm, it can be used to encrypt and decrypt files at different endpoints. It can only encrypt small files though, since the key has to be longer than the file. If a message is smaller than the key padding is used to make it equally sized. But if it were larger, a 1-on-1 mapping would not be possible, something the method is not designed for. So in order to encrypt large files, a symmetric (AES) key is usually generated and encrypted using an asymmetric algorithm (RSA) to be transfered to the other end node.
