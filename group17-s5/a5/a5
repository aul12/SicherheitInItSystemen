We need to find a hash which then has to be cracked.
In the news section of the website there is the first hint:
9/15/03 - Google was grabbing links it shouldn't be so I have taken extra precautions.

This is usually done by adding a robots.txt file to the root directory of the website. And sure enough:
https://www.hackthissite.org/missions/realistic/5/robots.txt
It says:

User-agent: *
Disallow: /lib
Disallow: /secret

meaning, that these directories should not be listed. /secret sounds interesting!
It contains a file called admin.bak.php which contains this:
error matching hash 0c95c956d133082576de45761baa2d7c

We found the hash!
