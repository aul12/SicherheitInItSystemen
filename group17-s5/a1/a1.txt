The aim is to manipulate the voting system by adding a higher score for the requested band (Raging Inferno).

This can be done by right clicking on the respective drop down menu and selecting "inspect element".
The html code of the site appears - and settings can be changed (only in the browser, obviously).
<select name="vote">
				<option value="1">1</option>
				<option value="2">2</option>
				<option value="3">3</option>
				<option value="4">4</option>
				<option value="5">5</option>
			</select>

Since the top ranking band has a score of 23, we change
<option value="5">5</option>
to
<option value="25">5</option>
and hit "vote".
