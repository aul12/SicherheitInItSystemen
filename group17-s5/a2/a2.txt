As stated in the exercise description an SQL injection attack is to be attempted.

Looking at the source code of the website reveals the login page:
https://www.hackthissite.org/missions/realistic/2/update.php
username should be "admin".
The sql vulnerability is not apparent, as single quote entries don't produce an error.
After some trial and error however (and some SQL errors), it turned out that password:
x' or 1=1--
did the trick.

The reason being that it doesn't matter what password we insert (in this case 'x') if there is the alternative of a true statement (1=1)
We can get rid of unwanted symbols (the ' at the end) by starting a comment with '--'
