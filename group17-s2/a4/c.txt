The capability to read files and directories needs to be given to the shell (bash in this case) and to cat. Otherwise cp as well as iterating through directories doesn't work (bash), neither does opening the dependency files (cat). The capability is set by

$ sudo setcap cap_dac_read_search+ep /bin/bash
$ sudo setcap cap_dac_read_search+ep /bin/cat

where +ep stands for adding effective and permitted capability.

By issuing the read capability to bash users can see all projects and files (could not be reproduced: bash: cd: projects/: Permission denied)

By searching for dependencies with a C program, the capability to read files only has to be granted to the program and not to bash. Thus users won't be able to see files and projects.
