Apart from the bridge function all functionality was already implemented in a1. To implement said brige functionality, setfacl is used to grant one specified user read and execute permissions on the specified project. As already reasoned in a1 this cannot be easily achieved using standard unix permissions since we can only distinguish three enitities: the owner, a group an all others. Therefor we cannot add individual users with individual permissions to the project. Using ACLs however we can grant arbitrary users access to files and directories.
